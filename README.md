# MvvmCross Extensions

Set of libraries that extend the awesome [MvvmCross](http://mvvmcross.com/) framework.
It contains base classes for views and viewmodels, specific platform controls, plugins and samples.
This is an ongoing project and every help/suggestion is welcome :)

See the [wiki](https://github.com/zleao/MvvmCross-Extensions/wiki) for detailed information about the project.
